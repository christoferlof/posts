Earlier this year I had the pleasure of collaborating on some content with [Richard Hundhausen](http://www.twitter.com/rhundhausen) for his book [Professional Scrum Development with Microsoft Visual Studio 2012](http://www.amazon.com/Professional-Development-Microsoft-Visual-Studio/dp/073565798X). It was recently released and it's a highly recommended read if you want to learn more on how TFS and Visual Studio can support your development process.

> Discover how to turn requirements into working software increments—faster and more efficiently—using Visual Studio 2012 in combination with Scrum and Agile engineering practices. Designed for software development teams, this guide delivers pragmatic, role-based guidance for exploiting the capabilities of Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) tools in Visual Studio and Team Foundation Server. Team members will learn proven practices and techniques for implementing Scrum to manage an application’s life cycle, as well as seamlessly plan, manage, and track their Scrum projects
