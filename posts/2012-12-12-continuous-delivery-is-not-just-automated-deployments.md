The Continuous Delivery wave seems to be what people are trying to surf these days.
I'm a bit worried though when I see posts and articles, especially from the Microsoft Community, where people claim they do Continuous Delivery when in fact the only thing they achieved is an automated deployment triggered by a check-in.

I believe there's more to Continuous Delivery and most of it is about people and their mindset and not the tooling. I do welcome the additions to TFS and Azure which makes it easier for newcomers to automate their deployments of web apps. But let us not stop there.
