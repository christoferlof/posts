Customers often ask about best practices and blueprints on how to build solutions for the cloud (on Microsoft Azure in particular). These days things evolve at a pace never seen before why developing reference architectures may be a very costly thing - once it's done it may be obsolete if it's produced with too much detail and too low level of abstraction. 

Instead I recommend to re-use IP already available (and being maintained) and also to rely on principles and patterns instead of implementation details.

Below is a list of excellent resources, created by teams at Microsoft based on real-world experiences, that will help you in building good (cloud) solutions. And to be honest; they'll help you build better on-prem solutions as well because the topics covered are not anything special to cloud solutions.
